There is no point to keep RCU read lock if we have rtnl lock,
I don't know why you don't want to change dev_get_by_flags(),
it is pretty easy to do since it only has one caller.

Even if you really need RCU in future, you are always welcome
to bring it back when you do, sorry we should never be blocked by
code NOT merged yet.
