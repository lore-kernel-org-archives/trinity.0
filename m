Sorry, just had time to look at this.

The reason is not to have list corruption but that the calls down to
ndo_set_rx_mode expect rtnl to be locked by the drivers. Filter lists
are locked by addr_list_lock and that's why I think we never saw any
problems with that, but drivers expect rtnl locked for those calls.

But this problem also affects multicast join, so patch seems incomplete
to me (and for that matter ssm multicast join, too).

Also rtnl_lock and rcu_read_lock compose in that order, so we don't need
to change dev_get_by_flags, but as this is the only user it sure is
possible. RCU locked version is just easier composeable, so I wouldn't
touch that if needed in future, just also take rcu lock as before.

So just adding rtnl_lock add appropriate places seems to be ok to me,
but still need to review parts of the ssm code.

Also we should move ASSERT_RTNL checks from addrconf_join_solict to
ipv6_dev_mc_inc/dec.

Thanks,
Hannes
