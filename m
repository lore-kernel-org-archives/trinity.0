Sure, I don't care about out-of-tree modules either. I just wanted to
make it easier to backport. Current patch is almost headache free to
backport.

Those ASSERT_RTNLs were misplaced and only caught the callers mostly
from addrconf.c. I don't mind getting reports from stable kernel users
and fixing those, too (or help fixing those). ASSERT_RTNL is not
dangerous.

We had a long history in not correctly using rtnl lock in ipv6/multicast
code and those wrongfully placed ASSERT_RTNLs were my bad when I fixed
the duplicate address detection handling.

If enough multicast addresses are subscribed to an interface we might
again get those splats because enabling promisc mode on an interface
will also check for rtnl lock.

Bye,
Hannes
