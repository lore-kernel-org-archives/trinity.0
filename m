ASSERT_RTNL() still performs a runtime check. While those are not really
fast paths, I still think it is better to keep them to a minimum and
place them only at places where we know all code which needs to be
guarded passes by:

I would suggest to move ASSERT_RTNL to ipv6_dev_mc_inc and
__ipv6_dev_mc_dec and even remove the checks from addrconf_join_solict
and addrconf_leave_solict. Does that cover all code paths and makes
sense?

The rest of the patch looks good.

Can you or Cong post a final patch with the adapted ac_join/drop
changes?

Thanks,
